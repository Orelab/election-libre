*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************

Create a MySQL database with the script located in the database/ folder, and edit the configuration files
located in the application/config/ folder.
